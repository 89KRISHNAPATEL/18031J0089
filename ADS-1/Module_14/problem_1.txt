Build a max heap with following elements(use the same insertion order) and answer the following questions 

100,  20, 3, 101, 54, 96, 103, 71, 60

      1.Number of heapify operations  required to build a max heap.

	ans:5

      2)  Leaf elements after performing 2nd heapify operation(Right to left).

	ans:20,71,60,54

      3) Leaf elements after inserting all elements into max heap(First child to last child).

	ans:101,100,71,54,96,3,20,60

      4) Elements at level 1 after building a heap. (Left to right)

	ans:20,103,101,54,96,3,71,60

      5) Children of 101 after building a heap.(Left to right)

	ans:71,54,20,60

      6)  Elements at level 1 after sorting 3 elements. (Left to right)

	ans:101,100


2.Suppose that your application will have a huge number of insert operations, 
but only a few remove the maximum operations. Which priority-queue implementation do you think would be most effective: heap, 
unordered array, ordered array?

ans:unorderedarray,insert is constant time.
